# Read Me Evidence Types

This Github repository is made during a thesis about evidence type classification at the Rijks Universiteit Groningen.

# Files:

# final_dataset.csv

This is a csv file with the annotated data, discussed and altered. This is a dataset with the continue label and without the continue label for multiple tasks.

# RoBERTa.py

This a python file, developed in colab. This is one of the machine learning models that predicts evidence types.

# AlBERT.py

This is a python file, developed in colab. This is the second machine learning model that predicts evidence types.

# Merged_annotations.py

This is a python file, developed in colab and in a normal text editor. This is a joint colaboration between myself (Friso Stolk) and Marieke Holt to get the final_dataset.csv file from the raw annotations.
