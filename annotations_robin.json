I've spent too much time arguing that allowing trans women into women's facilities is a safety issue for trans women to abandon that belief entirely.\n\nAs a cis woman, I have felt discomfort using unisex bathrooms. But when I think about it, the only basis for my discomfort was 'it's unusual'. The bathrooms are all stalls, so there's no risk of being exposed to unwanted genitalia. I am no more isolated or in danger than I would be passing through a corridor or in some barely-used stock cupboard, and we don't segregate those by gender.\n\nSometimes bathrooms are places where you go to sort out clothes or make up.

We already have disciplines, especially mathematics, that have been developing for thousands of years and we've never hit that limit.\n\nI think you mostly touch on the ideas that have *already* prevented those limits from being reached in your post, but don't explain why the rules are changing. The reason I don't believe this will happen (at least not in the near future-- the introduction of advanced deep learning tech will almost certainly produce information that is beyond the grasp of human knowledge today.) is because once we discover something, teaching that thing is almost infinitely easier than the time it took to discover that thing. Computers are a great example-- they took almost a century from the prototypical idea of a computer to a computer that would be somewhat recognizable today, and have accelerated greatly over the past 3 decades.

The Columbine killings were a terrorist attack, that was their intention. Same with Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City bombing or the 1993 trade center bombing. These acts were done by their perpetrators with the explicit reason being terror. That recent Christian guy who shot up that planned parenthood clinic intended to cause terror.

Also as another commenter highlights,  we're in the middle of an important referendum which not only affects us but all countries worldwide.\n\n&gt; I'm sure analysis will come and specific defining terms will be comitted to and stated later on - most likely after the referendum, so as to avoid being seen to be or in fact be influencing voters on either side.\n\nNot so much a CMV as such, more a hold that thought until after the referendum."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-30T10:20:56.891822Z","updated_at":"2022-04-30T19:41:20.171786Z","project":2},{"id":1784,"annotations":[{"id":722,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Continue"]},"id":"DqgOgiQKaE","from_name":"evidence","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-30T19:41:15.064027Z","updated_at":"2022-04-30T19:41:15.064027Z","lead_time":2.902,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":1784,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"5a198949-sentences_final.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"thread_id":"t3_4pbwvb","comment_id":"d4k35xh","sentence":"On the other, we see a common campaign of terror attacks that have a significant impact above and beyond their immediate victims.","comment":"While all these actions do fit one dictionary definition of terrorism, there are actually two distinct conceptualizations of terrorism in play here that are being equivocated on.

If the Charleston shooter were a member of the KKK, and the KKK regularly committed acts of terror (they don't actually do that nowadays AFAIK, but it's the closest thing I can come up with), then the media would call him a terrorist too.\n\nCalling what the Pulse shooter did 'Islamic terrorism' is as accurate as calling the Charleston shooter 'racist terrorism'.

For now, it just so happens that only brown people fall into the category of belonging to an organization that pushes a codified agenda using violence."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-30T10:20:56.891822Z","updated_at":"2022-04-30T19:33:47.717470Z","project":2},{"id":1746,"annotations":[{"id":684,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Continue"]},"id":"ZEK_wCCGbU","from_name":"evidence","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-30T19:33:22.140589Z","updated_at":"2022-04-30T19:33:22.140589Z","lead_time":6.376,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":1746,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"5a198949-sentences_final.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"thread_id":"t3_4pbwvb","comment_id":"d4jsbj4","sentence":"Of course they are *technically* terrorist acts but neither perp had any kind of network or clear agenda.","comment":"Personally I don't think either of these cases were what I'd call terrorism.

Maybe they show malice here because they realize that people are careless and will likely have to buy a new adapter. Apple, however, has stated on several occasions that their goal is wireless. On an anecdotal note, I’ve owned an iPhone 7 since October 2016 and I still have and use my original adapter every day. I even bought a spare to use at the gym. Also, keep in mind, that most people just use the pair of earbuds they got in the box with their phone - which in the case of the iPhone 7\/+ and 8\/+ is a pair of lightning EarPods.\n\nI also maintain that apple’s cables are built well. Generally speaking, however, people treat the cables like shit. Again, not apple’s fault. Again, maybe Apple knows that people treat cables like shit so they make a cable that works but needs to be replaced when it’s treated poorly. I buy Apple cables because I don’t treat mine like shit and I’d rather buy something that definitely isn’t gonna fry my battery - I’m cautious even with MFi certified products.\n\nThe compatibility of software and hardware is a double edged sword. Their software only works on their hardware. But, their software works really damn well on their hardware. This goes the same for their computers and their mobile devices.

Anything that hinders prosperity is a threat and should be eliminated to make the way easier for everyone.  Art and music and physical education all seem like a burden. This is what so much of the world is focused on,  but it misses the point of existence almost entirely and tries to make everything monetizable.  Making a contribution to the world is a wonderful goal, but increasing the world's GDP is not our function.  We are supposed to exist and grow and learn and have relationships with each other, often messy, complicated ones. The money is supposed to serve US. And sometimes there are people who don't contribute anything economically, or even negatively,  but as you said in your original proposition, \"my brother has downs and I love him\" is just as valuable to humanity, if not more in generating patience and compassion as making another screwdriver or the next usb cable.

Anything that hinders prosperity is a threat and should be eliminated to make the way easier for everyone.  Art and music and physical education all seem like a burden. This is what so much of the world is focused on,  but it misses the point of existence almost entirely and tries to make everything monetizable.  Making a contribution to the world is a wonderful goal, but increasing the world's GDP is not our function.  We are supposed to exist and grow and learn and have relationships with each other, often messy, complicated ones. The money is supposed to serve US. And sometimes there are people who don't contribute anything economically, or even negatively,  but as you said in your original proposition, \"my brother has downs and I love him\" is just as valuable to humanity, if not more in generating patience and compassion as making another screwdriver or the next usb cable.
