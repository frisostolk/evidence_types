I've spent too much time arguing that allowing trans women into women's facilities is a safety issue for trans women to abandon that belief entirely.\n\nAs a cis woman, I have felt discomfort using unisex bathrooms. But when I think about it, the only basis for my discomfort was 'it's unusual'. The bathrooms are all stalls, so there's no risk of being exposed to unwanted genitalia. I am no more isolated or in danger than I would be passing through a corridor or in some barely-used stock cupboard, and we don't segregate those by gender.\n\nSometimes bathrooms are places where you go to sort out clothes or make up. I can go in a stall if I need to change and there's no reason to be uncomfortable with a guy seeing me touch up my foundation.\n\nThere is no real negative effect on me for being in the same bathroom as a guy, which means I need to get over my discomfort.

We already have disciplines, especially mathematics, that have been developing for thousands of years and we've never hit that limit.\n\nI think you mostly touch on the ideas that have *already* prevented those limits from being reached in your post, but don't explain why the rules are changing. The reason I don't believe this will happen (at least not in the near future-- the introduction of advanced deep learning tech will almost certainly produce information that is beyond the grasp of human knowledge today.) is because once we discover something, teaching that thing is almost infinitely easier than the time it took to discover that thing. Computers are a great example-- they took almost a century from the prototypical idea of a computer to a computer that would be somewhat recognizable today, and have accelerated greatly over the past 3 decades. However, if you're a computer scientist, you probably spend at most a few classes learning all of that information throughout your academic life. \n\nCalculus is the same way. It took (essentially) one guy to write the rules to calculus, something no one before him really grasped, and now anyone interested in mathematics can learn that information in a year or two. \n\nEssentially it boils down to the fact that you don't have to \"relearn\" the info in every human life time.

They have less knowledge about racial dynamics than Americans who watch Fox News.

Apple is a rare bread of company that can pull off what would take 2 or more company to achieve.  Sometimes people think of Apple as this Giant company, but if you consider that they do all this software, hardware and sales on their own, they do it with less human resources than all other products on the market.\n\nAlso after taking courses in the sociology of technology, you come to realize that Apple is doing something very difficult very successfuly.

For every person who takes more than they give, there are several people who give more than they take. Most of the people in America don't see a dime of social program money until they turn 65, but they start contributing to them at 16 (or whenever they get their first job). Given how few people have Down's Syndrome, we can afford to help them. It's a pretty small number of people. \n\n2. This is a very slippery slope. Deciding who will have too poor a quality of life is a Pandora's box that should stay closed. You can start with Down's Syndrome babies-once it's been \"successful\" and they aren't costing anyone any more money, people will undoubtedly look for the next disposable group of people who are high-cost and low-producing. It'll probably be those with severe heart defects or sickle cell anemia-or some kind of disease that prevents you from holding down a steady job-and then trickle down to the mentally ill, those with depression and anxiety, and eventually, after a hundred years, we'll have winnowed down our gene pool to only \"perfect\" qualities. If this sounds extreme, just think about the small, tiny ways the most extreme things have been started.
