I don't want to pee next to heterosexual men (and the more I live as a reasonably attractive girl the less comfortable I am with that idea) and I believe there is at least some advantage to segregating facilities based on perceived sex. I've spent too much time arguing that allowing trans women into women's facilities is a safety issue for trans women to abandon that belief entirely.\n\nAs a cis woman, I have felt discomfort using unisex bathrooms. But when I think about it, the only basis for my discomfort was 'it's unusual'. The bathrooms are all stalls, so there's no risk of being exposed to unwanted genitalia.

But when I think about it, the only basis for my discomfort was 'it's unusual'. The bathrooms are all stalls, so there's no risk of being exposed to unwanted genitalia. I am no more isolated or in danger than I would be passing through a corridor or in some barely-used stock cupboard, and we don't segregate those by gender.\n\nSometimes bathrooms are places where you go to sort out clothes or make up. I can go in a stall if I need to change and there's no reason to be uncomfortable with a guy seeing me touch up my foundation.\n\nThere is no real negative effect on me for being in the same bathroom as a guy, which means I need to get over my discomfort. So I try to do that, and it's gradually working."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-29T13:49:20.169998Z","updated_at":"2022-05-03T08:20:47.781055Z","project":2,"updated_by":1},{"id":5403,"annotations":[{"id":1305,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Assumption"]},"id":"REEtFr5JDJ","from_name":"evidence","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-05-03T08:20:41.223763Z","updated_at":"2022-05-03T08:20:41.223900Z","lead_time":6.801,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":5403,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"55f6c370-sentences_final_1.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"thread_id":"t3_5w9qrn","comment_id":"de8j0eo","sentence":"Turns out that the only major differences between the \"Men's Room\" and the \"Women's Room\" were urinals and branding.","comment":"I live in Seattle.

Economically, that's a serious plus.\n* The existing bathrooms can be larger, as you don't need everything double. That's seriously nice for convenience.\n\nSafety? The more people use the same facilities, the safer they get.

Okay. Here's my practical solution:\n\n\n 1) Don't legally bar anyone from any bathroom. Yes that technically makes them unisex which you seem to mind, but I am not stopping there \n\n\n 2) Do require a minimum standard of privacy in bathroom stalls. Seriously. Half-inch gaps (or bigger!) in the stall doors are disturbingly common, as are woefully inadequate partitions. Unisex bathrooms are unappealing primarily for this reason.

People seem to have already argued the characters and writing, but I just want to put it in context. \n\nThe first Harry Potter movie came out right as I was finishing 5th grade. It's a Young Adult genre story. Kid with a crappy life finds out he is actually part of this story that both happened and is currently happening. Especially if you watch the first two movies, they aren't spectacular stories, but man do they capture the imagination of kids. I still remember the first time Harry went to Hogwarts both in the books I read, and the movies I watched. I remember when I was sick for a week my mom would read the books to me until I feel asleep. \n\nHarry Potter is to my generation as say the 80's was to an older generation. If you weren't a part of it, you would say \"what the hell are they wearing, and what were you thinking?\" But they will say it was the greatest decade of their life. Right or wrong, you can't really rate someones life experience, and I wouldn't expect someone like my dad to understand why Harry Potter was so important to my generation.

At that level, the writing is excellent, the world is surreal, the characters are very reasonable, and the plot is about what you'd expect.\n\n&gt; The relationships make no sense. Why does Harry like Cho or Ginny? Let's force in a relationship. Yay.\n\nWhy does any 12-year old boy like anybody?\n\n&gt; I don't like the writing either\n\nI write for a living and Harry Potter's language is very clean and refreshing.

The only thing that helps the poor climb out of the lower class is upward mobility, but if we're going to tax companies to such an extent that they cannot hire as many employees, that upward mobility becomes harder to attain.  We would also have to raise taxes on the middle and lower class to pay for such programs, which would take money out of circulation and throw it towards the already bloated and irresponsible government. Not to mention we would have to overhaul our immigration system and secure all borders completely, welfare states do not survive without these things.  \n\nUpward mobility should be a ladder you can climb up yourself, not a rope in which someone else pulls you up.

Innovation\n\nIt's really a catch 22, we want them to try new things but then we get mad when they do \"A prime example is the iPhone 7 and its missing 3.5mm headphone jack\", while i agree it does not seem very practical at least they are trying new things out. A lot of what we consider essential was though of as weird at first.\n\n2. OS\n\nThey really like quality, at the end of the day most programs on MAC have little to no issues when compared to the PC environment. This results in much less inventory but higher quality, in order to develop for OS you must do extensive testing and make sure things dont break, while on the PC world it's a lot quicker and easier to push your product out (faulty or not). While this has advantages\/disadvantages, Apple decided it wanted to control the quality of its products, hence the higher requirements to develop both hardware and software for apple.\n\n3.

This results in much less inventory but higher quality, in order to develop for OS you must do extensive testing and make sure things dont break, while on the PC world it's a lot quicker and easier to push your product out (faulty or not). While this has advantages\/disadvantages, Apple decided it wanted to control the quality of its products, hence the higher requirements to develop both hardware and software for apple.\n\n3. Own equipment\n\nBack to quality, while there are 20+ brands you can buy for PC, there are limited options for MAC but this has always been the case.\n\n\n4. Quality and pricey\n\nI mean yes, its expensive but i know my dad wont break his iphone software downloading the wrong apps or catch a virus. I know the UI is going to be simple and elegant and i am willing to pay more for it.\nIts similar to Mercedez and other brand cars that provide luxury and comfort at an added price"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-29T13:49:18.848941Z","updated_at":"2022-05-01T15:03:44.479296Z","project":2,"updated_by":1},{"id":3301,"annotations":[{"id":307,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Continue"]},"id":"Q9kYpxhAVO","from_name":"evidence","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-05-01T15:03:38.309386Z","updated_at":"2022-05-01T15:03:38.309519Z","lead_time":6.427,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":3301,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"55f6c370-sentences_final_1.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"thread_id":"t3_71l9yj","comment_id":"dnbkqtm","sentence":"The phrase \"at no additional charge\" is more accurate.","comment":"I really think you are being somewhat unfair here:\n\n&gt; AND requiring the user to purchase a separate lightning-to-3.5mm adapter that costs $10 and is described as \"fragile\" and \"poorly made\".\n\nThey give it to you ~~for free~~ _at no additional charge_ in the box when you purchase the phone.\n\n&gt;Mac OS is exclusive to Apple products, which forces me to pick up one of their $2000+ Macbooks if I want to even touch their operating system.\n\nYou can buy a Mac Mini for $499 on the website (not to mention the number of used offerings out there.

In theory, the idea of aborting certain types of fetuses or sterilizing the people that knowingly display risk factors for producing such a fetus sounds great and would greatly diminish the prevalence of disabilities, mental handicaps, genetic illnesses, and so on. But in practice, eugenics has always been a failed science. \n\n\nThe US experimented with eugenics in mental hospitals before WWII. We sterilized schizophrenic patients in an attempt to curb the overwhelming numbers of new schizophrenia cases. Germany of course dabbled with racial (and medical) eugenics during the war. The question of consent was a non starter in both cases; schizophrenics technically could not give consent to be sterilized because of their mental capacity (and because of being under the influence of heavy medication), and of course no one in Germany gave consent to anything, but sterilizations (and deaths in Germany's case) were carried out regardless \"for the good of the people\". **neither scenario played out well in the end\n\n\nIn the case of aborting fetuses that show abnormalities, were arguing free will. Should a person carrying a fetus with downs be allowed to practice free will and decide to keep it or abort on their own, or should someone step in and take away that free will to mandate an abortion? \n\n\nIn a moral sense, there really is no argument because everyone's moral compass is different and based off of individual experiences culminated over a lifetime. Some people morally oppose abortion; how would that be handled? Some people morally oppose even having sonograms or genetic testing done on (unborn) children, what then since they didn't know ahead of time? \n\n\nEdit because apparently I can't spell anything this morning"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-04-29T13:49:18.397753Z","updated_at":"2022-04-30T14:32:21.561224Z","project":2,"updated_by":1},{"id":2472,"annotations":[{"id":85,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Anecdote"]},"id":"LHwX_INlls","from_name":"evidence","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-04-30T14:11:26.730137Z","updated_at":"2022-04-30T14:31:55.439857Z","lead_time":8120.795,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":2472,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"55f6c370-sentences_final_1.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"thread_id":"t3_6rwcio","comment_id":"dl8cj5p","sentence":"In my experience the positive effect retarded people have on those around them is enormous.","comment":"I think your premise is flawed.
