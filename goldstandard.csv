Medicine is perhaps the most obvious example of information overload; it's impossible for a single physician to treat every possible disease state or even know how to go about proper diagnosis and initial management; rather they know when they don't know the answer and refer to colleagues with different specializations.,Anecdote

It's possible (likely even) that we will also create technology that will allow us to modify human brain to acquire information extremely quickly.,Assumption

His intent was certainly to induce terror and fear into the gay population.,Definition

Since the term terrorism is used very loosely and for political gain all the time I'd say we first go and define exactly what a terrorist is.,None
It all depends on the motivation of the perpetrator.,None
We know that they're mass murderers and that ought to be sufficient enough to lock them up for the rest of their lives whether they end in old age or execution.,Assumption

Did they do it for political or religious motivations?,Definition

Why does this event conjure up an agenda for you?,None
But you might ask yourself what is your motivation for asserting this viewpoint?,None
I'm not discounting that.,None
"I have seen everything that says he was a disgruntled gay, etc.",None
You're getting hung up on terminology and it appears you are very reluctant to classify this as an Islamic Extremists who killed gays in the name of Allah just as dozens upon dozens of Islamic Extremists have been doing for decades and very frequently in the last 15 years.,Assumption
"For now, it just so happens that only brown people fall into the category of belonging to an organization that pushes a codified agenda using violence.",Assumption

"Basically, you're seeing racism where there isn't any.",Assumption
The only reason the Charleston shooter isn't labeled a terrorist is because there is no racist anti-black terrorist group with an agenda that he could have claimed to have been pushing.,Assumption
Calling what the Pulse shooter did 'Islamic terrorism' is as accurate as calling the Charleston shooter 'racist terrorism'.,Assumption
"If the Charleston shooter were a member of the KKK, and the KKK regularly committed acts of terror (they don't actually do that nowadays AFAIK, but it's the closest thing I can come up with), then the media would call him a terrorist too.",Assumption
"The line is exactly where it always has been - if they are using fear to push an agenda, they are a terrorist.",Assumption
"&gt;Where do we draw the line between ""disturbed mental patient"" and ""terrorist""?",None
Of course they are *technically* terrorist acts but neither perp had any kind of network or clear agenda.,Assumption

I could see some problems with censorship if the government actually runs the internet.,Assumption
Will it be a government contact with a private company or a government run internet company?,Assumption
It would just add more money to the national debt and the government doesn't have a good record of allocating money efficiently compared to a business because wasted money isn't as much of a concern to a government.,Assumption
A system like this would be unsustainable in the long run.,Assumption
I'm also concerned with the cost.,None
Why would I need the government to provide these things when all they'll do is move money around in the form of taxation?,None

"That to me will always be morally repulsive, and so I cannot support it on those grounds.",Assumption
But that's still money being spent on you from people who were unwilling to give it to you to begin with.,Assumption
"The other way to do it, as is normally done in welfare systems, is through collective taxation.",Assumption
"But shelter, food, water, medical care, those are products and services that require constant action and effort from others to produce / provide.",Assumption

"If I deserve an education from the government, then someone is forced to teach it to me.",None
If I force government to provide me food then the government has a right to force someone to provide that food.,None

"The way you say it, every person should have all of their basic needs cared for regardless of the efforts they put into acquiring them.",Assumption
"Of course everyone WANTS those things, but absolutely no one is entitled to any of them.",Assumption
"There are no ""rights"" guaranteed to anyone that has not been purchased with blood and/or money, and the idea that you could simply legislate all nations of the world to come to agree on any one topic is ludicrous.",Assumption
"thats why things like access to food, water, etc will never be in the same ""rights"" category as other things like human rights and cannot/should not be guaranteed",Assumption
you have the right to be treated like a human being regardless of the situation.,Assumption
rights like human rights are intangible and not dependent on whether there is a drought or not.,Assumption
if you have the right to food but there is none how is your government supposed to respond?,Other
the problem with having these things as rights is that they are tangible and their existence are dependent on the environment the country is in.,Assumption

"It never will work, and god help us all if it's ever tried again.",None
What you've got here is basically Stalinism-Lite.,Assumption

It has become a dependence for most of us-I'm willing to bet that most kids high school age or younger wouldn't even know how to do a research paper without it.,Assumption

"If I, as a graduate student with enough of a stipend to afford the basics choose, can I elect to have the free shelter, food, and water (if no, how can you ascertain who does, without potentially removing ""access"" by those who need it)?",Other
Is this violated by there NOT being free food available to anyone who asks?,None
"What does it mean to ""have access""?",None
"Doing this would require we change the legal definition of ""human"" to exclude people below a certain income bracket because they can't afford computers, phones or often even homes.",Assumption
You lost your entire readership as soon as you suggested internet be a basic human right.,Assumption
"If this were to happen, innovation and drive within society as a whole would be driven down, and there is a significantly higher chance of extinction of the human race.",Assumption
"I mean hell, if I could get all of those things now, why even try to fight to get to the top, I could be perfectly happy with just those.",Assumption
"In this system, you could choose to never work and still be fine, and have a good life overall.",Assumption
"As you put in your edit, you think this will be able to be done through automation in 10-20 years.",Assumption
"I agree that it could be done if automation really picks up, however my problem with this is that it takes away from a productive society, and a society that wants to make improvements.",Assumption
They need to fix that and they would be able to have this program.,Assumption
The government mismanagement of funds have been going on for far too long.,Assumption
I am not willing to up my taxes paid for anymore.,Assumption
The problem is that the money needs to come from somewhere and it's usually the tax payer.,Assumption
"And even middle of the road countries (Brazil, Russia, China) have trouble providing such things because corruption is still rampant.",Assumption
There's no way an African country would be able to afford such things.,Assumption
"They're poor, ravaged by corruption and lack stable institutions.",Assumption
The problem is developing countries.,Assumption
"Developed countries usually have programs for the poor to afford food and water, they have environmental regulations and air quality control, public housing, universal primary and secondary education and libraries with internet access.",Assumption
And most do.,Assumption
For developed countries it is possible to do all of those things.,Assumption
"In the US, your future is more open till you reach high school, and thats more when kids will really care more about their future.",Assumption

"If you do badly, your secondary school won't prepare or allow you to go to college.",Assumption
"If you do well, your secondary school is on a college track, and prepares you for a white collar life.",Assumption
In many places in Germany you take a test in the 4th grade that determines what kind of secondary school you will go to.,Assumption
So by your own admission you've just said that Germany is worse if you're a republican.,Assumption

"Finally, while Germans are generally good English speakers, it is clealy not the best place to learn the most common global language.",Assumption
"I'll be a bit snarky and say that likely the most world-recognized German product is beer, and the flourishing US micro/nano-brewery movement is imporving faster then the regulated German beer industry.",Assumption
This means that the variety of great cuisines in the US is unmatched.,Assumption
Immigration has been a huge benefit to the US throughout its history and the resulting culture is the most diverse in the world.,Assumption

"There's some signs that is changing, but the very signs those are (recent political developments in reaction to refugees, etc) is something you'd apparently regard as bad news.",Assumption
"Which is one reason why demographically, Germany is not just dying, but can't even bring itself to regard said death as a bad thing.",Assumption
"Also: Germany is largely a laughingstock, considered by people to be utterly ashamed of anything resembling nationality, pride in German culture, and otherwise.",Assumption
Very little of what you say has anything to do with your title claim.,Assumption
Your content largely comes down to 'If you hold all of my values and like all the things I do with the same priorities I do then you'll like Germany better than the US.',Assumption

Edit:

But seruously though, the ""murica"" phenomenon is a mass exercise in self deprecating humor that simultaneously recognizes americas greatness and sympathizes with the mildy anti-american sentiment commonly held by many among the international community (basically spoofing our arrogance as a way of saying that we arent hot stuff)",None

Overall their quality of life is automatically lower than most other people.,Assumption
